# IP Data Analysis
From November 11th up until December 3rd, 2025, my poorly secured Virtual Private Servers were hacked by some bad actors.

Each `.txt` file inside `data` was generated by running the following command in each of the compromised servers:
```
sudo journalctl | grep sshd | grep "Accepted"
```

The provided [Jupyter Notebook](ip-data-analysis.ipynb) computes some Explorative Data Analysis on the data I collected and generates the following CSV files:
* [summary_statistics.csv](summary_statistics.csv)
* [top_ip_analysis.csv](top_ip_analysis.csv)
* [daily_activity.csv](daily_activity.csv)
* [full_dataset.csv](full_dataset.csv)
